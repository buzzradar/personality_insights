You are melancholy: you think quite often about the things you are unhappy about. And you are authority-challenging: you prefer to challenge authority and traditional values to help bring about positive changes.\nExperiences that give a sense of revelry hold some appeal to you.\nYou are relatively unconcerned with tradition: you care more about making your own path than following what others have done. You value helping others a bit more: you think it is important to take care of the people around you.","watson_profile":{"personality":[{"name":"Openness","percentile":0.7254430379746836,"children":[{"name":"Adventurousness","percentile":0.6514556962025317},{"name":"Artistic interests","percentile":0.5014556962025316},{"name":"Emotionality","percentile":0.2665822784810127},{"name":"Imagination","percentile":0.615126582278481},{"name":"Intellect","percentile":0.7587974683544304},{"name":"Authority-challenging","percentile":0.6578481012658227}]},{"name":"Conscientiousness","percentile":0.5824050632911393,"children":[{"name":"Achievement striving","percentile":0.4878481012658228},{"name":"Cautiousness","percentile":0.595632911392405},{"name":"Dutifulness","percentile":0.4588607594936709},{"name":"Orderliness","percentile":0.5803164556962025},{"name":"Self-discipline","percentile":0.46993670886075944},{"name":"Self-efficacy","percentile":0.4929746835443038}]},{"name":"Extraversion","percentile":0.2720886075949367,"children":[{"name":"Activity level","percentile":0.529620253164557},{"name":"Assertiveness","percentile":0.46462025316455696},{"name":"Cheerfulness","percentile":0.20278481012658228},{"name":"Excitement-seeking","percentile":0.4427215189873418},{"name":"Outgoing","percentile":0.2912658227848101},{"name":"Gregariousness","percentile":0.22582278481012658}]},{"name":"Agreeableness","percentile":0.15987341772151897,"children":[{"name":"Altruism","percentile":0.3585443037974684},{"name":"Cooperation","percentile":0.4905696202531646},{"name":"Modesty","percentile":0.4284177215189873},{"name":"Uncompromising","percentile":0.3861392405063291},{"name":"Sympathy","percentile":0.43246835443037973},{"name":"Trust","percentile":0.5374683544303798}]},{"name":"Emotional range","percentile":0.725886075949367,"children":[{"name":"Fiery","percentile":0.43234177215189873},{"name":"Prone to worry","percentile":0.3963291139240506},{"name":"Melancholy","percentile":0.5741772151898734},{"name":"Immoderation","percentile":0.3551898734177215},{"name":"Self-consciousness","percentile":0.6279746835443037},{"name":"Susceptible to stress","percentile":0.4281012658227848}]},{"name":"Needs","percentile":0.5,"children":[{"name":"Challenge","percentile":0.35778481012658225},{"name":"Closeness","percentile":0.1541139240506329},{"name":"Curiosity","percentile":0.4558860759493671},{"name":"Excitement","percentile":0.3720253164556962},{"name":"Harmony","percentile":0.2291139240506329},{"name":"Ideal","percentile":0.3289873417721519},{"name":"Liberty","percentile":0.35981012658227846},{"name":"Love","percentile":0.15170886075949366},{"name":"Practicality","percentile":0.524620253164557},{"name":"Self-expression","percentile":0.3061392405063291},{"name":"Stability","percentile":0.3376582278481013},{"name":"Structure","percentile":0.5036075949367088}]},{"name":"Values","percentile":0.5,"children":[{"name":"Conservation","percentile":0.28455696202531644},{"name":"Openness to change","percentile":0.41689873417721524},{"name":"Hedonism","percentile":0.2738607594936709},{"name":"Self-enhancement","percentile":0.355126582278481},{"name":"Self-transcendence","percentile":0.2615822784810127}]}],"needs":[{"name":"Challenge","percentile":0.35778481012658225},{"name":"Closeness","percentile":0.1541139240506329},{"name":"Curiosity","percentile":0.4558860759493671},{"name":"Excitement","percentile":0.3720253164556962},{"name":"Harmony","percentile":0.2291139240506329},{"name":"Ideal","percentile":0.3289873417721519},{"name":"Liberty","percentile":0.35981012658227846},{"name":"Love","percentile":0.15170886075949366},{"name":"Practicality","percentile":0.524620253164557},{"name":"Self-expression","percentile":0.3061392405063291},{"name":"Stability","percentile":0.3376582278481013},{"name":"Structure","percentile":0.5036075949367088}],"values":[{"name":"Conservation","percentile":0.28455696202531644},{"name":"Openness to change","percentile":0.41689873417721524},{"name":"Hedonism","percentile":0.2738607594936709},{"name":"Self-enhancement","percentile":0.355126582278481},{"name":"Self-transcendence","percentile":0.2615822784810127}]},"gender":{"unknown":2,"male":124,"female":32},"view":"\n\n    \u003Cdiv class=\u0022col-md-3\u0022\u003E\n        \u003Cimg src=\u0022\/bundles\/insights\/images\/personalities\/entrepreneur.svg\u0022 \/\u003E\n    \u003C\/div\u003E\n\n    \u003Cdiv class=\u0022col-md-9 left-line\u0022 style=\u0022line-height:150%;\u0022\u003E\n        \u003Ch2 style=\u0022margin-top:0px;\u0022\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EEntrepreneur\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003C\/h2\u003E\n\n        You are unconventional and somewhat inconsiderate.\nYou are demure: you prefer to listen than to talk, especially in group situations.
